Communicate Data Findings
Yellow Taxi Trip
Introduction:
This data provided by the yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations,
 Trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. 
The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) 
By technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP).

In this project, we will apply what I've learned on exploratory data analysis on a dataset and
 Explanatory analysis. This project is to have the opportunity to ask questions of the data and make your own discoveries.
We collected information from the dataset, we answered questions about Yellow Taxi Trip Records. Moreover, we visualized diversifying chart types.
